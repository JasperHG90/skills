# Subagent Design Guide

Deep treatment of the six design dimensions from `SKILL.md`, plus a gotchas
list. Read a section when that decision gets hard. The framing throughout: a
subagent is not a smaller chat and not a function call — it is a worker with an
**isolated context**, a **data-shaped return value**, a **tool boundary**, and
(if registered) a **description that is the only thing a caller reads before
delegating**. Every dimension below falls out of one of those facts.

## 0. Should this agent exist at all?

The first job is sometimes to talk the user *out* of an agent. Isolation is not
free:

- The agent starts with **no memory of the parent conversation**. Every call
  pays a re-briefing tax.
- Its result must be **marshalled back** into the parent's context, costing
  tokens proportional to how much it returns.
- It **cannot spawn its own subagents** (one-level nesting). An "agent" that
  needs to fan out further is mis-modelled.

Reach for an agent when at least one of these holds:

- **Independent scope** — the work is a self-contained unit with a clean input
  and output, not deeply interleaved with the parent's reasoning.
- **Parallelizable** — you want several of these running at once (the blueprint
  skill fans out four analysts), or you want this off the critical path.
- **Context hygiene** — the work reads/produces a lot that the parent doesn't
  need to keep (a big search, a noisy log scan); isolating it protects the
  parent's window.

If none holds, prefer **inline** work. If the thing is really a *reusable
procedure* a human or agent invokes ("how we do X here"), it's a **skill**, not
an agent — point the user at `skill-creator`. Saying "this shouldn't be an
agent, here's why" is a valid and valuable outcome of this skill.

## 1. Single responsibility

One nameable job. The test: state the responsibility in a sentence with no
"and". "Maps the external API surface of a repo" passes. "Maps the API and
fixes inconsistencies and writes docs" is three agents.

Why it matters beyond tidiness: a single responsibility is what makes the agent
**triggerable** (the caller can tell when it applies) and **verifiable** (you
can write assertions about a narrow job). A sprawling agent triggers
unpredictably and fails in ways no assertion catches. When scope creeps, split
into sibling agents that a parent composes, rather than one agent that does
everything.

## 2. Prompt/body split + injected-context contract

The dimension people most often get wrong. A subagent receives instructions
from **two** places and you must decide what goes where:

- **The body** (static, written once, identical every run): role, method,
  constraints, output shape, quality bar. Things true of *every* invocation.
- **The spawn prompt** (written by the parent at call time): the specific task,
  the target path/file/PR, facts the parent already discovered and wants to
  share so the agent doesn't re-derive them, and where to put outputs.

Worked example — the blueprint skill's spawn block hands each analyst the repo
directory and a Phase-1 facts summary, while the analyst body
(`agents/pattern-analyst.md`) contains only the generic "how to analyse
patterns" method. The body never hardcodes a repo path; the parent never
re-explains how to analyse.

Make the contract explicit in the body. A short **"Inputs (provided at spawn)"**
section listing what every caller must supply turns an implicit assumption into
a checkable interface. Two failure modes this prevents:

- **Body assumes un-injected context** — e.g. references "the file you were
  given" when no spawn prompt named a file. The agent hallucinates or stalls.
- **Body hardcodes what should be injected** — e.g. a fixed path or a baked-in
  task, making the agent un-reusable.

## 3. Output contract

The agent's final message is **consumed by the caller**, not shown to the user.
Two consequences:

1. **Define the shape.** Give the body an explicit output template (markdown
   sections, or a JSON schema when a Workflow consumes the result and validates
   it). `pattern-analyst.md` and `feature-planner.md` both end with a concrete
   output format — copy that discipline.
2. **Summarise, don't dump.** The caller pays context for everything returned.
   A tight, structured verdict (the 3 findings that matter) beats a 500-line
   transcript of everything the agent looked at. Tell the agent to return
   conclusions and evidence, not its working notes. For a fan-out where the
   parent aggregates N results, this is the difference between a usable
   synthesis and a blown context window.

If the result feeds a deterministic Workflow step, prefer **structured output**
(JSON matching a schema) so the parent can branch on it without parsing prose.

## 4. Tool allowlist as guardrail

`tools:` is least-privilege *and* a contract-enforcer. The cleanest examples in
this repo are the read-only reviewers: `feature-planner.md` and
`adversarial-reviewer.md` both omit `Edit`/`Write` so they *physically cannot*
mutate the repo — the boundary is enforced by the harness, not by the agent
remembering to behave.

Guidelines:

- Grant the **narrowest set** the method actually needs. A research agent:
  `Read, Grep, Glob` (+ read-only `Bash` if it runs `git`/`ls`). A reviewer:
  add `Bash` for running tests/linters but still no `Edit`. A migration agent:
  `Edit`/`Write` + whatever it builds with.
- **Be explicit.** Omitting `tools` means "inherit everything" — which hides the
  boundary and over-grants. List the tools so a reader sees the agent's reach at
  a glance.
- For a **body-only** agent, the file has no `tools` field; the parent grants
  tools at spawn (`subagent_type`). State the intended restriction in the body's
  prose and make sure the parent honours it.

## 5. Parallelism & isolation

If the agent **writes files** and might run **concurrently** with siblings or
copies of itself, plan for collisions:

- **Idempotency** — writing to a deterministic, per-task path so two runs don't
  clobber each other, and re-running is safe.
- **Worktree isolation** — when agents mutate a shared tree in parallel, each
  gets its own git worktree so edits don't conflict; the cost is real, so only
  do it for genuinely parallel writers.

Other isolation facts to design around:

- **No mid-run user interaction.** A subagent generally can't stop to ask the
  user a question. Design it to make the reasonable call and **flag the
  ambiguity in its output** (an "Open questions" section), so the parent or user
  resolves it after. Blocking on a question it can't ask is a hang.
- **One-level nesting.** It can't spawn subagents. If the job needs further
  fan-out, that orchestration belongs in the parent (or a Workflow), not the
  agent.

## 6. Trigger (registered only)

For a registered agent, the `description` is the *entire* basis on which a
caller decides to delegate. Treat it as the product surface.

- **Lead with the artifact/verb** so it's unmistakable ("Adversarially review
  work produced by another agent…", "Produces a high-level feature ticket…").
- **Cover when to use** with the phrasings a user/parent would actually say.
- **Invest in anti-conditions.** The "NOT for…" clauses carry equal weight to
  the triggers — they're what stop the agent firing on adjacent-but-wrong tasks.
  Name sibling agents it might be confused with and draw the line (e.g. "NOT for
  orchestrating a multi-agent build — that's dev-team").
- **Model tier** is the knob here: `haiku` for mechanical/cheap, `sonnet` for
  the default, `opus` for deep reasoning, architecture, or adversarial work.
  Match it to the hardest thing the agent must do; don't over-think it.

A body-only agent has no description — its triggering is the parent skill's
spawn logic. Don't try to encode a trigger in a frontmatter-less file.

## Gotchas

- **The agent can't see this conversation.** Anything obvious to you right now
  (which repo, which file, what the user just said) is invisible to the agent
  unless the body states it or the spawn prompt injects it.
- **The result isn't a user message.** Don't write bodies that say "tell the
  user…" — there is no user on the other end, only the caller consuming data.
- **Context budget is shared at aggregation.** N agents each returning a wall of
  text can overflow the parent that collects them. Cap and summarise.
- **Description over-pushiness causes mis-fires.** Making a description aggressive
  to fight under-triggering can make it poach tasks meant for a sibling agent.
  Balance pushy triggers with sharp anti-conditions.
- **Inheriting all tools is a silent over-grant.** An agent with no `tools:`
  field can edit, delete, and run anything — easy to miss in review. Prefer an
  explicit list even when it's long.
- **"Make it an agent" is sometimes wrong.** Re-run dimension 0 whenever the job
  is small, deeply interleaved with the parent, or really a reusable procedure
  (→ skill).
